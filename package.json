  "description": "Hi there! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my repo where I share some cool websocket app examples. Websockets are a way of creating real-time communication between a web server and a client. They allow you to send and receive messages without reloading the page. ðŸ˜Ž In this repo, you'll find some examples of how to use websockets for different purposes, such as chat, games, notifications, etc. Feel free to explore, clone, fork, and star the repo. If you have any questions or feedback, just open an issue or a pull request. I hope you enjoy these websocket app examples and learn something new. Happy coding! ðŸš€",
