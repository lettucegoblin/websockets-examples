# Description
Hi there! 👋  Websockets are a way of creating real-time communication between a web server and a client. They allow you to send and receive messages without reloading the page. 😎 
## In this repo you will find:
- Server side:
  - A websocket & express server.js that is ran with node.js. 🚀
  - It hosts the public folder with the index.html file. 📁
- Client side:
  - /public/index.html: A html file with bootstrap, socket.io, and /public/js/chatapp.js. 📁
  - /public/js/chatapp.js: A javascript file that connects to the server and sends and receives messages. 📁
